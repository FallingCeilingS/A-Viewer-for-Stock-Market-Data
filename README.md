This dialog is consist of input components for user to query specific market data for a ticker, including:
- A drop-down box for selecting a ticker symbol from a list.
- Two drop-down boxes for selecting the start and end dates respectively. 
- A submission button that allows user to submit input data to retrieve correspond stock market data.

There are some restrictions regarding user input before hitting the "Submit" button:
- All input fields should not be empty.
- The start date cannot be ahead of the end date.
- The device should connect to the internet.

Otherwise, a dialog will pop up to show error message, and the query process will not be able to proceed.

If the input fields are valid, and the internet is connected, the endpoint provided by WSJ will be hit. Then, data retrieved from the API should be displayed in a separate window. 
This window draws a graph showing the ticker data within the selected date range:
- The stockâ€™s open, closing values for each day in the grey line chats.
- The stock's high and low value for each day in the rectangles.
- The horizontal coordinate shows dates, and the vertical coordinate shows stock prices.
